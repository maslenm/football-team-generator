# AutoTeam

- This project is built using React and Redux.

- It is my solution to the technical challenge brief set by DevelopMe to create a tool that will randomly select 2 teams for a 5-a-side football match, from a list of 10 players.

# To get the App setup on your machine -

### 1. Clone the repo by running -

`git clone git@github.com:maslenm/football-team-generator.git`

### 2. Install all the required packages by running-

`npm install`

### 3. Run the app by running -

`npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# AutoTeam Tool Features

- Add your 10 player names
- Click the create button to generate two random teams
- Has the option to reshuffle

# About The Build

Its made using React and Redux, and uses CSS for the styling.

In it's current state it meets the MVP and meets the minimum brief as far as I understand it.
Due to my time limitations I decided this was all that was achievable for now.

# Future updates

The next step for the app would be the following features :

- Add Team names

- Allow for different number of players eg. 3v3, 4v4 ..etc

- Add player skill level

- Even up the teams by skill level

- Allow for tracking score

- Edit teams/players

- Add back-end support
